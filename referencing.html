<h2>Referencing</h2>

<p> If you have found a SAT article useful in your research, we encourage you to
acknowledge that fact by referencing it in your publication. Each SAT article is
uniquely identified by its publication date, e.g. SAT 1 (2005), 1-45, just like any
journal article. However, as SAT is solely web based, its web address is a crucial
part of the citation. We recommend citing a SAT article such as in the following 
example:</p>

<p> Pinkus, A., Density in Approximation Theory, 
<i>Surveys in Approximation Theory</i>, <b>1</b> (2005), 1-45.
