<h2>For Authors</h2>

<p> The various macros (basic and advanced) and format and figure and 
instruction files in TeX and LaTeX.</p>


<p><strong>TeX:</strong>Refer to the <a href="instruct.pdf">instruct</a> file.
 
Also, for a minimal format for references, the files <a href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~deboor/texinputs/journal.tex">journal.tex</a>,
<a href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~deboor/texinputs/proceed.tex">proceed.tex</a>, and <a href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~deboor/texinputs/refmac.tex">refmac.tex</a>,
from the <a href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~deboor/bib/bib.html">spline bibliography</a>. The file journal.tex gives, at its end, a complete
description of the minimal format.</p>

<p><strong>Acceptance:</strong> If your article is accepted for publication,
we will request the (LaTeX or TeX) source file and any other files needed to
compile it. Publication will follow shortly after acceptance of the article
and receipt of a <a href="copy">publication release form</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Publication Ethics:</strong> The editors support and subscribe to the codes of
journal publication ethics as to be found at the <a href="http://www.euro-math-soc.eu/system/files/COP-approved.pdf">European 
Mathematical Society (EMS)</a> and the <a href="http://www.ams.org/about-us/governance/policy-statements/sec-ethics">
American Mathematical Society (AMS)</a>.</p>  

<p>The following is quoted from the American Mathematical Society's Ethical Guidelines:

<BR><BR>
``Editors are responsible for the timely refereeing of articles and must judge
articles by the state of knowledge at the time of submission. Editors should
accept a paper for publication only if they are reasonably certain the paper
is correct.

<BR><BR>
The contents of submitted manuscript should be regarded by a journal as
privileged information. If the contents of a paper become known in advance of
publication solely as a result of its submission to or handling by a journal,
and if a later paper based on knowledge of the privileged information is
received anywhere (by the same or another journal), then any editor aware of
the facts must refuse or delay publication of the later paper until after
publication of the first---unless the first author agrees to earlier
publication of the later paper.

<BR><BR>
At the time a manuscript is submitted, editors should notify authors whenever
a large backlog of accepted papers may produce inordinate delay in
publication. A journal may not delay publication of a paper for reasons of an
editor's self interest or of any interest other than the author's. The
published article should bear the date on which the manuscript was originally
submitted to the journal for publication, together with the dates of any
revisions. Editors must be given and accept full scientific responsibility
for their journals; when a demand is made by an outside agency for prior
review or censorship of articles, that demand must be resisted and, in any
event, knowledge of the demand must be made public.

<BR><BR>
Both editors and referees must respect the confidentiality of materials
submitted to them unless these materials have previously been made public,
and above all may not appropriate to themselves ideas in work submitted to
them or do anything that would impair the rights of authors to the fruits of
their labors. Editors must preserve the anonymity of referees unless there is
a credible allegation of misuse.''
