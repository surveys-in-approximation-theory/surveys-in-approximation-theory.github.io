<hr> <strong>Abstract</strong>. 
We survey developments, over the last thirty years, in the theory of Shape
Preserving Approximation (SPA) by algebraic polynomials on a finite 
interval. In this article, "shape" refers to (finitely many changes of) 
monotonicity, convexity, or <i>q</i>-monotonicity of a function (for 
definition, 
see Section 4). It is rather well known that it is possible to approximate a 
function by algebraic polynomials that preserve its shape (i.e., the 
Weierstrass approximation theorem is valid for SPA). At the same time, the 
degree of SPA is much worse than the degree of 
best unconstrained approximation in some cases, and it is "about the same" 
in others. 
Numerous results quantifying this difference in degrees of SPA and 
unconstrained approximation have been obtained in recent years, and the main 
purpose of this article is to provide a "bird's-eye 
view" on this area, and discuss various approaches used.
<br>
In particular, we present results on the validity and invalidity of uniform 
and pointwise estimates in terms of various moduli of smoothness. We compare 
various constrained and unconstrained approximation spaces as well as orders 
of unconstrained and shape preserving approximation of particular functions, 
etc. There are quite a few interesting phenomena and several open questions.
